The purpose of this document is to collect future improvements or optimizations in the current Geofilter Rapp, or its associated daemon Geoip:

Improvements and suggestions on Polygon Filtering:
    -Partition the world space to avoid checking with polygons in far distances (Maybe follow a QuadTree approach)
    -Since the world coordinates are integers, we could preprocess all the combinations of integer pairs (lat and long)
     to create a lookup table for the polygons and avoid calculating the lines
    -To improve accuracy, we could move the model to use floating point numbers.
    -Add support for different polygon sets (So the user has not to draw them each time, and can change between different sets for different games/apps)
