Description:  Ogg project codecs use the Ogg bitstream format to arrange the raw,
 compressed bitstream into a more robust, useful form.  For example,
 the Ogg bitstream makes seeking, time stamping and error recovery
 possible, as well as mixing several sepearate, concurrent media
 streams into a single physical bitstream.
