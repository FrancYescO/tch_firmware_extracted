Description:  urngd is OpenWrt's micro non-physical true random number generator based on
 timing jitter.
 
 Using the Jitter RNG core, the rngd provides an entropy source that feeds into
 the Linux /dev/random device if its entropy runs low. It updates the
 /dev/random entropy estimator such that the newly provided entropy unblocks
 /dev/random.
 
 The seeding of /dev/random also ensures that /dev/urandom benefits from
 entropy. Especially during boot time, when the entropy of Linux is low, the
 Jitter RNGd provides a source of sufficient entropy.
