-- Commit & Apply module.
--
-- Idea is that a set of rules and corresponding actions is loaded.
-- All configuration changes are reported to the commit & apply context
-- who will check whether any rules match that change. If so, the
-- corresponding action is queued for execution.
-- When commit & apply is told to apply all changes it will execute
-- all queued actions asynchronously in the background.
--
-- A rule file must have a .ca extension. Each line must contain a
-- rule and an action, separated by whitespace.
-- A rule is any valid string pattern for use by Lua's string.match()
-- function. It cannot contain any whitespace.
-- An action is any valid command that can be executed. Whitespace is
-- allowed, e.g. to separate command line arguments from the application.
