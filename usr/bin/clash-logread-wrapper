  clash-logread-wrapper is designed for the CLI's (clash) logread command.
  It may be used from a root shell, but this is not its main purpose.

  Summary:
    The script has three options available:
      '-f'       : Output data as log grows; see `logread -f`
      '-i'       : If a filter is set, filter the output case-insensitive
      '-F'       : Output data in the file which is set by option 'log_file' in /etc/config/system
      '--filter' : A Lua pattern filter;
              only lines that match the filter are printed.

    The wrapper script provides a mechanism to filter logread's output against a set filter, if any.

  Background:
    Clash knows a `filter` feature on a selection of commands, such as `logread` and `get`.
      For `get`, the filter is implemented by using Lua pattern matching. `get` is an internal command in which case the
      filtering is performed within Clash core code.
      To keep user experience consistent throughout Clash, it is desirable to apply the same filtering mechanism for logread.

      Logread, however, is an external debug command, which once launched simply pipes all its output to Clash.
      Plainly launching `/sbin/logread` would thus provide no facilities for post-processing such as matching the output
      against a pattern (i.e. filtering).

    The wrapper script provides a solution by capturing the logread output and filtering when required.
    Hence the script's main tasks:
      * Checking prerequisites, and reporting errors if necessary:
          * `logread -f` must not be used with a filter.
          * Option `-i` must only be used with a filter.
      * For `logread -f`, simply launch a task by execv(); filtering is currently not supported with `-f`.
      * For normal logread (without `-f`), capture the output and either:
          * Simply print when no filter active.
          * Match against the filter (with `-i`, case-insensitive) and print when matching.
