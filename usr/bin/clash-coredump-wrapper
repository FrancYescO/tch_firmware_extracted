# clash-coredump-wrapper is designed for the CLI's (clash) coredump command.
# It may be used from a root shell, but this is not its main purpose.

# Summary:
#   The script has two options available:
#   '-l'             : list files from predefined path.
#   '-p <file name>' : write the specified file to stdout
#
#   These options must not be used in conjunction.

# The wrapper will simply cat the one and only coredump file that exists
# in `uci get system.@coredump[0].path` (if any) to stdout.
# Hence, `-p` is only intended for use with a redirection operator on a client.
