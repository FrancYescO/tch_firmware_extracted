  clash-upgrade-wrapper is designed for the CLI's (clash) upgrade command.
  It may be used from a root shell, but this is not its main purpose.

  Summary:
    The script has two options available:
      '-d <URL>'  : download image from URL and program it to passive bank
      '-s'        : switch over to the other bank

    The CLI user upgrades the gateway in two steps:
     (1) `upgrade -d http://server/pathto/image.rbi ` calls `sysupgrade-safe -o`; downloads and programs the passive bank.
     (2) `upgrade -s` calls our switchover() function which sets said `<passive bank>`
          to the active bank in banktable, and then reboots to complete the upgrade.

  Background:
    Calling `/usr/bin/sysupgrade-safe <URL>` without option '-o' does not work for following reasons:
      * sysupgrade-safe uses sysupgrade.
      * After downloading image and programming other bank, sysupgrade calls a function `kill_remaining`.
      * `kill_remaining` sends a TERM signal to all but critical processes running on gateway.
      * This TERM signal kills clash.
      * Per design, this makes clash kills all its child processes.
      * This kills sysupgrade-safe and sysupgrade.
      * The upgrade then hangs forever.
    The wrapper script provides a solution by
      * always calling sysupgrade-safe with option '-o' (download and program passive bank only).
      * providing a simple switchover by setting active bank to the programmed passive bank, then reboot.
      * it also provides the opportunity to define our own interface, decoupled from sysupgrade-safe: refer to `Summary` and upgrade command's usage_msg.
        Hence, we can provide a method to switch bank and reboot asynchronously from the download: refer to switchover().
