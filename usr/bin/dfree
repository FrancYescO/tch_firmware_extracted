# reference manual:
# The external program will be passed a single parameter indicating a directory
# in the filesystem being queried. This will typically consist of the string
# ./. The script should return two integers in ASCII. The first should be the
# total disk space in blocks, and the second should be the number of available
# blocks. An optional third return value can give the block size in bytes. The
# default blocksize is 1024 bytes.
