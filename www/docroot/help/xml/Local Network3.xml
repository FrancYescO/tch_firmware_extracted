  <h2>
    <a name="43047" />Static leases<note><p>This section is not available when the device is switched to bridged mode.</p></note></h2>
  <p>By default, each device will get an IP address from the <var name="1-productname01" />'s DHCP server. When a device leaves, is turned off or the lease time of the address has expired, the IP address becomes available and can be re-used for other devices.</p>
  <p>When you want to run a service on a network device (for example, a web server, network printer, etc.), it is advised to assign a reserved IP to the device. This way, the device will always be reachable on the same address and there is no risk that you are accessing the wrong device.</p>
  <p>The <b>Static leases </b>section on the <b>Local Network</b> page allows to manage your static leases.</p>
