  <h2>DMZ</h2>
  <h4>
    <a name="22172" />DMZ</h4>
  <p>The <var name="1-productname01" /> allows you to configure one local device as a De-Militarized Zone (DMZ) host. This means that:</p>
  <li1>All traffic originating from the Internet will be forwarded to this devices unless there is a port forwarding rule defined for this type of traffic. Port forwarding rules always have higher priority.</li1>
  <h4>Use a reserved IP address for the DMZ host</h4>
  <p>Make sure that your DMZ host uses a fixed IP address. If not, the device might get a new IP address after some time through DHCP and the port forwarding rule will no longer be applied to the device and another device may suddenly be acting as DMZ host. For more information, see <link href="Local Network3.xml#43047">Static leases<note><p>This section is not available when the device is switched to bridged mode.</p></note></link>.</p>
  <h4>DMZ settings</h4>
  <p>Under <b>DMZ</b>, you can configure the following settings:</p>
  <li1>Enabled<br></br>Allows you to enable or disable DMZ.</li1>
  <li1>Destination IP<br></br>The IP address of the device that you want to use as DMZ host.<note><p>You can also type in (a part of) the host name of the device. The <var name="1-productname01" /> will then display a list of devices with such a host name. If you then click one of the results, the <var name="1-productname01" /> will insert the corresponding IP address.</p></note></li1>
