#
# This file replaces the first 15 entries in entityInfoArray in eid.c
# 3 types of entities are listed in this file:
# a. the tr69c app itself
# b. subscriber LAN side configuration apps.  TR-069 can always control
#    the MDM write access of these apps.
# c. other management apps whose MDM write access can be controlled by TR-069

# See cms_eid.h and TR-069 A.3.2.4 for more details.

# Only 15 entries are allowed in this file.  Do not add any
# more entries here.  If you are adding a management app whose access
# to the MDM can/should be controlled by TR69, look for AVAILABLE or
# delete an entry that is not used in your system, e.g. TR64
#
# Fields not set here are initialized to zero or NULL.
# All field values must be on a single line
