# clash-mpstat-wrapper is designed for the CLI's (clash) mpstat command.
# It may be used from a root shell, but this is not its main purpose.

# The wrapper's reason of existence is two-fold:
#   1. circumvent mpstat's unbuffered output. If `mpstat` is plainly executed, its unbuffered output
#      ends up in chunks in clash, and the linenoise library adds a newline to every chunk.
#      This leads to malformatted output that is not usable by the user.
#   2. if called with [INTERVAL [COUNT]] options for regular updates, mpstat's output must
#      printed to stdout as soon as a full line is available.
#      If not using a loop, the data only ends up in clash once the command returns.


# Simply call mpstat with the provided arguments, and echo the output line by line.
